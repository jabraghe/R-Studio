# Hello
# Here you are going to learn how to create a Sankey Diagram with the networkD3 library.

# In my example, the Sankey Diagram will show a timeline of some of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings.

# You are listening: Solitude - Sakamoto Ryuichi.
# I chose this composition because I think it reflects Van Gogh's fragile soul.

# You need to install the following package: install.packages('networkD3')
library(networkD3)

# networkdD3: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/networkD3/networkD3.pdf

# Let's list some of Van Gogh's paintings in a dataframe:
nodes = data.frame("Vincent" = 
                     c("1853: Vincent is born", # Node 0
                       "1881: Crouching Boy with Sickle", # Node 1
                       "1882: Woman with White Shawl", # Node 2
                       "1883: Peasant Burning Weeds", # Node 3
                       "1884: Winter Garden", # Node 4
                       "1885: The potato Eaters", # Node 5
                       "1886: Self-Portrait", # Node 6
                       "1888: CafÃ© Terrace At Night", # Node 7
                       "1888: Sunflowers",# Node 8
                       "1889: The Bedroom", # Node 9
                       "1889: Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear",# Node 10
                       "1889: Starry Night", # Node 11
                       "1890: Wheatfield With Crows", # Node 12
                       "1890: Almond Blossoms", # Node 13
                       "1890: Tree Roots (Last Van Gogh's Painting)" # Node 14
                       ))
nodes # the (rows - 1) corresponde to the nodes

# Here we create our node connections
links = as.data.frame(matrix(c(
  0, 1, 1, #here: "1853: Vincent is born" --> "1881: Crouching Boy with Sickle"
  0, 2, 1,
  0, 3, 1,

  byrow = TRUE, ncol = 3))

names(links) = c("source", "target", "value")
links
# Each row represents a link. 
# The first number represents the node being conntected from. 
# The second number represents the node connected to.
# The third number is the value of the node (in this example, all equals to 1).

# Here is where we create our Sankey
# define the colourScale
colourScale = JS("d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory20);")

sankeyNetwork(Links = links, Nodes = nodes,
              Source = "source", Target = "target",
              Value = "value", NodeID = "Vincent",
              fontSize= 8, nodeWidth = 10, nodePadding = 140,
              colourScale = colourScale)

# I now try to make it a bit nicer

# A Sankey diagram is a flow diagram generally used to depict a flow from one set of values to another.
# The things being connected are called nodes
# (in our examples the nodes are the paintings) and the connections are called links.
# A real-world example: Google Analytics uses sankeys to show
# how traffic flows from pages to other pages on your web site.
